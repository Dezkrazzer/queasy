## Files Created/Modified

### 1. Frontend Files

#### `src/views/admin-live.ejs` (NEW)
- Halaman admin dashboard lengkap dengan:

### 2. Routing

#### `src/routers/IndexRouters.js` (MODIFIED)
- Added route: `router.get('/admin/live/:gameCode', ...)`
- Authentication check: Requires logged-in user session
- Returns minified and obfuscated admin-live.ejs

### 3. Lobby Logic

#### `src/views/lobby.ejs` (MODIFIED - Lines 178-192)
- Added `isHost` flag tracking
- Modified `game_started` event handler:
  ```javascript
  if (isHost) {
      window.location.href = `/admin/live/${gameCode}`; // Host → Admin Dashboard
  } else {
      window.location.href = `/quiz/${gameCode}`; // Player → Quiz Page
  }
  ```

### 4. Server Socket.IO Handlers

#### `server.js` (MODIFIED)
Added 3 new Socket.IO handlers after line 442:

**1. `admin_join_live` Handler**
- Validates game existence
- Joins admin to game room
- Sends initial game data:
  - Quiz title
  - Total questions
  - Current question index
  - Participant list with scores
- If game in progress, sends current question data

**2. `admin_navigate_question` Handler**
- Accepts direction: 'next' or 'prev'
- Updates `game.currentQuestionIndex`
- Broadcasts new question to all players and admin
- Resets player answer status for new question
- Sends `participants_update` with reset status

**3. `admin_end_quiz` Handler**
- Sorts players by score
- Creates leaderboard
- Broadcasts `game_over` to all
- Cleans up game from `activeGames`

**Modified Existing Handlers:**

**`player_answer` Handler (Line ~930)**
- Added broadcast to admin when player answers:
  ```javascript
  io.to(gameCode).emit('player_answered', {
      playerId, playerName, answerId, isCorrect, score
  });
  ```
- Added `participants_update` broadcast with updated scores

**`showQuestionResult` Function (Line ~340)**
- Added broadcast to admin after question results:
  ```javascript
  io.to(gameCode).emit('participants_update', game.players.map(...));
  ```

## Socket.IO Event Flow

### Admin Connects
1. Admin loads `/admin/live/:gameCode`
2. Client emits `admin_join_live`
3. Server responds with `game_data` (quiz info + participants)
4. If game in progress, server sends `game_question` with current question

### Player Joins Lobby
1. Player joins game
2. Server broadcasts `lobby_update` to all (including admin if monitoring)

### Game Starts
1. Host clicks "Start Game"
2. Server emits `game_started`
3. Host redirects to `/admin/live/:gameCode`
4. Players redirect to `/quiz/:gameCode`

### Player Answers
1. Player submits answer
2. Server emits `player_answered` to admin room
3. Admin UI updates participant status real-time
4. Server emits `participants_update` with latest scores

### Question Ends
1. All players answer OR timer expires
2. Server calls `showQuestionResult()`
3. Server emits `question_result` to each player individually
4. Server emits `participants_update` to admin with latest scores
5. After 5 seconds, advances to next question

### Admin Navigation
1. Admin clicks Previous/Next button
2. Client emits `admin_navigate_question` with direction
3. Server updates question index
4. Server broadcasts `game_question` to all
5. Server resets player answer status
6. Server emits `participants_update` with reset status

### Admin Ends Quiz
1. Admin clicks "End Quiz" button
2. Client emits `admin_end_quiz`
3. Server sorts leaderboard
4. Server broadcasts `game_over` to all
5. Server cleans up game

### Quiz Naturally Ends
1. Last question timer expires
2. Server calls `endGame()`
3. Server broadcasts `game_over` to all
4. Admin receives game over notification

- [ ] Player disconnects mid-game → Verify admin sees updated participant count

## Known Limitations

1. **Manual Navigation**: Admin can manually navigate questions, but this might confuse players if used during active quiz
2. **No Pause Feature**: No pause/resume functionality
3. **No Real-time Chart Animation**: Chart updates but without smooth animations
4. **Fixed Timer**: Timer shows question time limit, doesn't sync with server countdown

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add pause/resume functionality
- [ ] Add chat/messaging between admin and players
- [ ] Add export results to CSV/PDF
- [ ] Add real-time analytics (average response time, etc.)
- [ ] Add question skip functionality
- [ ] Add manual participant removal
- [ ] Add sound notifications for player answers
- [ ] Add dark mode toggle

## Dependencies

- Socket.IO v4.5.4: Real-time bidirectional communication
- Alpine.js v3: Reactive frontend framework
- Chart.js v4.4.0: Pie chart visualization
- Feather Icons: UI icons
- Tailwind CSS: Styling

## Architecture Notes

- **Authentication**: Route requires `req.session.user` to be set
- **Real-time**: All updates use Socket.IO room-based broadcasting
- **State Management**: Alpine.js reactive data binding
- **Memory**: Game state stored in `activeGames[gameCode]` on server
- **Cleanup**: Games auto-deleted 30 seconds after ending
